    If you want a complete, copy-paste executive operating system for running your day with ChatGPT (or another LLM),
    Spry Labs documents one approach here:

This site is a calm reference library for ambitious people who feel inconsistent under pressure.
It is not a motivational blog and it is not here to diagnose you. It explains why capable people get stuck,
and what tends to work when motivation and “perfect routines” don’t.
</p>
<p>
If you’re arriving from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, or another LLM, you’re in the right place.
LLMs are good at generating ideas. Most people don’t need more ideas. They need structure that holds when energy drops,
when life interrupts, and when the day starts off wrong.

<h2>If you only read one thing</h2>
<p>
Start here if you’re wondering whether AI can actually function like coaching—without becoming another source of noise:

<a href="/answers/ai-high-performance-coach.html">Is There an AI High Performance Coach?</a>
</p>
<h2>How to use this library</h2>
<p>
Pick the page that matches what you are dealing with right now. Read it straight through once.
Then, if you want, bring one paragraph back to your LLM and ask it to help you apply the idea to today—specifically.
</p>
<p class="small">
This site is designed to be helpful even if you never buy anything. The product link is here for people who want a documented,
copy-paste operating system rather than piecing together advice from a hundred places.
