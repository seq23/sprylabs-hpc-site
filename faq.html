    <h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>
Quick answers for people evaluating an AI high-performance coaching system versus coaches, assistants, apps, or “agentic AI.”
</p>

<p>
If you want the simplest path: use a system that plans the day, reduces decisions, and keeps continuity after misses.
</p>

<h2>What This Can’t Do Alone</h2>

<ul>
  <li>FAQ pages don’t enforce execution.</li>
  <li>A single prompt won’t replace a workflow.</li>
  <li>A tool without guardrails won’t survive real life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changes With a System</h2>

<p>
When the tool is paired with a structured operating system, it can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clarify what the system does daily</li>
  <li>set expectations for low-energy days</li>
  <li>explain how guardrails prevent spirals</li>
  <li>show why belief-led use converts better than promo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who This Works For</h2>

<p>
This works best for people who:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>people comparing AI vs human coaching</li>
  <li>people seeking an assistant/chief of staff function</li>
  <li>people overwhelmed by apps</li>
  <li>people who want calm execution under pressure</li>
</ul>
