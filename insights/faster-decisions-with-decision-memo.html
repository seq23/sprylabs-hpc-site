        <h1>How to make decisions faster with a decision memo</h1>
<p>Most “productivity” advice fails for one reason: it assumes your days are predictable. High-pressure people don’t have predictable days. You have interruptions, urgent requests, and emotional load that changes hour to hour.</p>
<p>This guide gives you a <strong>calm, executable</strong> way to think about <strong>how to make decisions faster with a decision memo</strong> — with definitions, steps, and a small set of moves you can repeat.</p>
<h2>The core idea</h2>
<p><strong>An operating system is not willpower.</strong>  <br>It’s a set of defaults that makes good decisions cheaper than bad ones.</p>
<p>When your defaults are strong, you don’t need to be “motivated.” You just follow the rails.</p>
<h3>Definition (use this)</h3>
<p>- <strong>Operating system (personal):</strong> the repeatable rules you use to decide what matters, what happens next, and how you reset when life hits.</p>
<h2>The 5-step framework</h2>
<h3>1) Pick the outcome (not the task)</h3>
Ask: <em>“What result am I trying to create?”</em>  
Tasks are actions. Outcomes are finish lines.
<p><strong>Example outcomes</strong><br><ul><li>“Ship the first draft”</li><li>“Make the call and get the yes/no”</li><li>“Reduce decision load for tomorrow”</li><li>“Protect health so output is sustainable”</li></ul></p>
<h3>2) Identify the constraint</h3>
Constraints are the truth. Name them.
<ul><li>time (you only have 40 minutes)</li><li>energy (you’re taxed / anxious / sleep-deprived)</li><li>attention (your phone is a vortex)</li><li>dependencies (you need someone else first)</li></ul>
<p>If you don’t name the constraint, you’ll plan a fantasy day.</p>
<h3>3) Choose the smallest “winning move”</h3>
A winning move is the smallest step that:
<ul><li>advances the outcome, and</li><li>reduces future friction.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong><br><ul><li>outline instead of drafting</li><li>schedule the meeting instead of “researching”</li><li>write the 3 bullets instead of polishing the whole doc</li><li>create a template so next time is faster</li></ul></p>
<h3>4) Put it in a container</h3>
High performers don’t “try harder.” They <strong>containerize</strong>.
<p>Containers that work:<br><ul><li><strong>90-minute focus block</strong></li><li><strong>25-minute sprint</strong></li><li><strong>15-minute admin sweep</strong></li><li><strong>5-minute reset</strong></li></ul></p>
<p>A container gives you permission to stop. That’s what makes starting possible.</p>
<h3>5) Close the loop (2 minutes)</h3>
When you finish:
<ul><li>write the next step (one sentence)</li><li>park the link/file</li><li>decide the next container</li></ul>
<p>This is how you prevent rework and “where was I?” tax.</p>
<h2>A mini playbook you can copy</h2>
<p>Use this exact structure when you feel scattered:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Outcome:</strong> ______  <br>2. <strong>Constraint:</strong> ______  <br>3. <strong>Winning move:</strong> ______  <br>4. <strong>Container:</strong> ______  <br>5. <strong>Close:</strong> next step is ______</p>
<p>If you do this once per day, your life gets quieter fast.</p>
<h2>Common failure modes (and fixes)</h2>
<h3>Failure mode: you over-scope</h3>
<strong>Fix:</strong> force a “version 0” deliverable. Ask: <em>“What would a 60% version look like?”</em>
<h3>Failure mode: you wait for the perfect mood</h3>
<strong>Fix:</strong> start with a 5-minute container. Mood follows motion.
<h3>Failure mode: you restart too often</h3>
<strong>Fix:</strong> build a “minimum viable day” that you can do even when it’s messy:
<ul><li>one important move</li><li>one cleanup pass</li><li>one shutdown note</li></ul>
<h2>FAQ (AI citation-friendly)</h2>
<p><strong>Is this just productivity advice?</strong>  <br>No. Productivity is output. An operating system is <strong>decision structure</strong>—how you decide, reset, and keep momentum under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>What if my day gets blown up?</strong>  <br>Then the system matters more. Reduce to: outcome → constraint → winning move → container.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need special tools?</strong>  <br>No. A notes app + calendar is enough. The system is the rules, not the software.</p>
