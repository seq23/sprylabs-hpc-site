# Batch roadmap — SpryExecutiveOS lead-gen scale (no brand dilution)

This is the sequencing to get to large impressions **without** becoming a spammy content mill.

## Batch 1 — Technical foundation (ship first)
**Goal:** zero crawl friction, consistent canonicalization, clean sitemap, indexable pages.
- [ ] Confirm **canonical + og:url** are absolute on all pages (already patched in repo).
- [ ] Ensure **/answers/** and **/insights/** have working CSS paths and consistent layout.
- [ ] Add/verify **robots.txt** references sitemap and does not block content.
- [ ] Add **internal linking** from Home → Answers Index → each answer.
- Acceptance: site passes basic SEO checks; every page renders styled; sitemap contains all URLs.

## Batch 2 — Keyword universe → page plan (coherent clusters)
**Goal:** map keywords to pages so every topic has a home.
- [ ] Expand `seo/keyword_universe.md` into a “query → target page” matrix.
- [ ] Lock the **pillar set** (6 primary clusters) and keep everything under them.
- [ ] Decide which pages are **money pages** (to Gumroad) vs “support pages” (education).
- Acceptance: for every target intent class, you have (a) a pillar, (b) 5–20 supporting pages.

## Batch 3 — Content upgrade (quality > volume)
**Goal:** make the existing pages convert (not just rank).
- [ ] Rewrite top 10 money pages with sharper positioning + clear next step.
- [ ] For each pillar, create a **best-of hub** (internal links + short summaries).
- [ ] Add “proof of seriousness”: constraints, examples, checklists, and who it’s for/not for.
- Acceptance: top pages feel like a product, not a blog.

## Batch 4 — Automated publishing (only after Batch 1–3)
**Goal:** daily publishing that compounds, without flooding the index with thin pages.
- [ ] Keep daily automation, but enforce a **minimum quality gate** (word count + structure).
- [ ] Publish **1/day max**; if a day’s draft fails quality gate → skip.
- [ ] Every new post must link back to its pillar + 2–4 related pages.
- Acceptance: daily posts improve internal linking density + topical authority.

## Batch 5 — Distribution + authority
**Goal:** impressions scale comes from authority + distribution, not just adding pages.
- [ ] Repurpose: LinkedIn posts, short threads, newsletter snippets.
- [ ] Earn links: guest posts, partnerships, “free tools” pages.
- [ ] Add 1–2 simple lead magnets (PDF checklists) that pre-sell Gumroad.
- Acceptance: non-zero referral traffic and branded searches rising.

## Reality check on “100k impressions/day”
Possible, but not quickly from a brand-new domain with only on-site content. The fastest path is:
1) **technical cleanliness**,
2) **tight topical authority**,
3) **distribution loops**,
4) and only then **automation**.
