# SpryExecutiveOS Keyword Universe (Exhaustive + Clustered + Non‑Diluted)

## The rule
SpryExecutiveOS is **not** generic productivity SEO.

It is for:
- high‑stakes operators
- execution under pressure
- systems that survive bad weeks
- direct, calm, non‑cheerleader voice
- emotionally intelligent + grounded (but **not** therapy cosplay)

This universe is built around **6 core pillars + 1 AI pillar**. Each pillar includes: intent buckets, head terms, Spry‑tail long‑tail, and query templates you can mass‑produce without drifting off‑brand.

---

## Pillar A — High Performance Coach (Spry flavor, not guru)
### Intent buckets
- definition / what is
- fit / who needs it
- cost / ROI
- alternatives
- how it actually works
- red flags / scams
- AI vs human

### Head + mid terms (you must own)
- high performance coach
- executive coach (framed as **decision + execution under stakes**)
- accountability coach / accountability partner
- performance coach for entrepreneurs
- coach for founders / CEOs
- coach for overwhelmed high achievers
- coach for procrastination (Spry framing: **avoidance loops**)

### Spry‑tail long‑tail (high‑converting)
- high performance coach for overwhelm
- high performance coach for execution
- coach for decision fatigue
- coach for founder burnout
- coach for stuck / can’t start
- coach for inconsistent routines
- coaching for high pressure leadership
- coaching for ambitious but depleted
- coaching for people who hate routines

### Query templates (mass‑produce)
- What does a high performance coach actually do?
- Is a high performance coach worth it?
- High performance coach vs therapist
- High performance coach vs executive coach
- High performance coach vs mentor
- How to choose a high performance coach (questions to ask)
- Signs a coach is selling motivation not systems
- What to expect in the first 30 days of coaching

**Canonical Spry stance:** coaching = constraints + sequencing + recovery paths + decision support.

## Pillar B — Executive Dysfunction / Overwhelm / Avoidance (Spry owns this)
### Head terms
- executive dysfunction
- overwhelmed at work

- What to do when your brain refuses to work
- How to regain traction after a bad week
- How to stop rebuilding the plan every day

## Pillar G — AI Coach / AI Chief of Staff (careful “AI therapist” handling)
### What we can safely capture
- ai coach
- ai accountability partner
- ai chief of staff
- ai planner
- ai executive assistant
- ai productivity assistant

### “AI therapist” (careful)
We can capture the query intent **without** making clinical claims:
- “AI therapist” content must be framed as **non‑clinical support**: reflection, journaling prompts, planning help, crisis‑unsafe disclaimers, and strong “not therapy” language.

### Query templates
- AI coach vs human coach
- AI chief of staff: what it can and can’t do
- AI accountability partner that doesn’t shame you
- Is an AI coach safe? What to watch for

---

## Keyword classes (you must cover all)
To reach large impression volume, you need coverage by *class*, not just “posts”:
- Definition pages (“what is X”)
- Comparison pages (“X vs Y”)
- Template pages (“template / checklist / script”)
- Symptom/problem pages (“why do I…”)
- Scenario pages (“for founders / execs / high pressure roles”)
- Cost/price pages (“how much does…”) 
- Alternatives pages (“alternatives to hiring…”) 
- Best‑of pages (“best accountability partner…”, framed as “what actually works”)
- Objection pages (“is this a scam / does coaching work / will AI replace coaches”)
- Implementation pages (“how to run this system daily”)

---

## Cluster map (site information architecture)
**/topics/** = hub pages (coherence + internal linking multiplier)
- /topics/high-performance-coaching/
- /topics/overwhelm-executive-dysfunction/
- /topics/accountability-consistency/
- /topics/productivity-systems/
- /topics/burnout-recovery/
- /topics/systems-thinking-decisions/
- /topics/ai-coach-chief-of-staff/

**/answers/** = short canonical SERP capture (definition/comparison/cost/objections)

**/insights/** = long‑tail volume machine (templates, scenarios, deep dives)

---

## Implementation note
The repo now includes **topic hubs** in `topics/` and the build script includes them in **sitemap.xml** and **llms.txt** so they index and “pull up” the whole site.
