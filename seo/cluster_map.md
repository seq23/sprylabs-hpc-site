# Spry keyword + content cluster map

This repo is **SpryExecutiveOS.com** (lead-gen to Gumroad). Clusters are designed to keep the brand coherent while still capturing broad search intent.

## Primary clusters (pillars)

1) **AI High-Performance Coach (Governed)**
- Intent: people searching for *AI coach*, *high performance coach*, *AI executive coach*, *AI accountability partner*.
- Angle: not “motivation”; it’s constraint + execution systems.
- Risks: must avoid therapy/medical claims.

2) **Overwhelm / Executive Dysfunction (for high performers)**
- Intent: frozen, avoidance, overwhelm, “can’t stick to routine”, burnout-adjacent.
- Angle: diagnosis-free, practical recovery paths.

3) **Accountability + Consistency (streakless)**
- Intent: accountability partner, consistency, habit failure, “never miss twice”.
- Angle: recovery protocol, constraints, friction removal.

4) **Chief of Staff / Life Ops**
- Intent: personal ops, life admin, chief of staff, executive assistant systems.
- Angle: operating rhythms + single source of truth.

5) **Productivity Systems (anti-app)**
- Intent: productivity system, planning, to-do apps, routines, decision fatigue.
- Angle: governance + sequencing vs “tool shopping.”

6) **Burnout + Recovery (capacity rebuild)**
- Intent: burnout, recovery, rest guilt, sustainable pacing.
- Angle: capacity as a system; downshift without collapse.

## Secondary clusters (supporting)
- **Systems thinking + decision-making** (leverage, constraints, feedback loops)
- **Ambition + long-horizon** (standards vs perfectionism)
- **Wendy-Rhoades archetype** (direct coaching vibe; keep it respectful)

## “AI therapist” handling (careful)
If you publish content using *AI therapist* keywords, it must be framed as:
- **reflection / journaling / coaching-style prompts**, not diagnosis, treatment, or crisis support.
- include a visible disclaimer: not medical/mental-health advice; for crisis use local emergency resources.
- avoid promises or clinical language.
