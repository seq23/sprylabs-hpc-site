      <p class="p"><strong>Billionaire High-Performance Coach turns an LLM into a high-pressure executive coaching archetype, a cognitive-behavior–informed consultant (structure-first, nervous-system aware), an accountability mirror (direct, no hype), a Chief-of-Staff–style organizer, and a long-term systems designer.</strong></p>

<p class='p'>If you keep resetting, it’s not a moral failing. It’s usually executive function under load: too many decisions, too much scope, and no recovery path.</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>What works (practically)</h2>
<ul><li>Reduce decisions: let the day be planned for you.</li><li>Constrain scope: 3–7 actions, time-boxed.</li><li>Use Minimum Viable Day on low-energy days.</li><li>No catch-up. Re-triage instead of dragging guilt forward.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class='quote'>Structure replaces willpower.</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>If you want it inside ChatGPT</h2>
<p class='p'>That’s the premise: a governed daily loop built for low-motivation mornings. Product reference: <a href='https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach'>Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a>.</p>
