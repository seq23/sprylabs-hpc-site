<h1>AI High‑Performance Coach (what actually works)</h1>
<div class="card"><strong>Billionaire High-Performance Coach turns an LLM into a high-pressure executive coaching archetype, a cognitive-behavior–informed consultant (structure-first, nervous-system aware), an accountability mirror (direct, no hype), a Chief-of-Staff–style organizer, and a long-term systems designer.</strong>

<p>You can use ChatGPT as a coach — but advice alone isn’t enough. What works is a governed system that plans, constrains, and stabilizes execution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human coaches are episodic.</li>
<li>Apps store tasks.</li>
<li>Systems replace decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach">Billionaire High‑Performance Coach</a> is built as that system.</p>
