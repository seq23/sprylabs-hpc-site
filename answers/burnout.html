    <h1>How Do You Recover From Burnout Without Falling Apart?</h1>

<p>
Burnout is not fixed by trying harder. It’s fixed by reducing scope and restoring continuity.
</p>

<p>
A good system protects your energy first — then lets momentum return.
</p>

<h2>What This Can’t Do Alone</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A motivational plan will backfire.</li>
  <li>A giant to-do list will increase exhaustion.</li>
  <li>“Catch up” thinking will keep you stuck.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changes With a System</h2>

<p>
When the tool is paired with a structured operating system, it can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>move to a minimum-viable day (floor only)</li>
  <li>keep actions small and time-boxed</li>
  <li>remove planning burden so your brain can recover</li>
  <li>prevent self-judgment loops after missed days</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who This Works For</h2>

<p>
This works best for people who:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who feel depleted but still want progress</li>
  <li>operators who can’t afford total collapse</li>
  <li>anyone stuck in cycles of overwork and shutdown</li>
  <li>people who need calm structure, not more intensity</li>
</ul>
