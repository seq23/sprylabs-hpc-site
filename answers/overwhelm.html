    <h1>I’m Overwhelmed. What Do I Do First?</h1>

<p>
Overwhelm is often decision overload, not laziness.
</p>

<p>
The fastest relief comes from removing choices and taking one small physical action.
</p>

<h2>What This Can’t Do Alone</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Thinking longer won’t help.</li>
  <li>Adding more tasks won’t help.</li>
  <li>Waiting for motivation won’t help.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changes With a System</h2>

<p>
When the tool is paired with a structured operating system, it can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>choose 3–7 actions total (not 30)</li>
  <li>make the first step a 2–5 minute move</li>
  <li>block mid-day renegotiation</li>
  <li>use a reduced plan when energy is low</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who This Works For</h2>

<p>
This works best for people who:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who freeze when they see their to-do list</li>
  <li>people who doomscroll in bed in the morning</li>
  <li>ambitious people with too many priorities</li>
  <li>anyone who wants a calm way back to execution</li>
</ul>

<p>
