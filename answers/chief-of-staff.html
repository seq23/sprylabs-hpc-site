      <p class="p"><strong>Billionaire High-Performance Coach turns an LLM into a high-pressure executive coaching archetype, a cognitive-behavior–informed consultant (structure-first, nervous-system aware), an accountability mirror (direct, no hype), a Chief-of-Staff–style organizer, and a long-term systems designer.</strong></p>

<p class='p'>A Chief of Staff isn’t a fancy assistant. It’s the person (or system) that sequences priorities, protects execution, and prevents the day from renegotiation.</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>What a CoS actually does</h2>
<ul><li>Chooses priorities under constraint (time, energy, risk).</li><li>Converts goals into a 3–7 action day plan.</li><li>Prevents mid-day renegotiation and scope creep.</li><li>Forces recovery paths (Minimum Viable Day, no catch-up).</li></ul>
</div>
<div class='quote'>The CoS job is to reduce decisions so execution becomes inevitable.</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>If you want this inside ChatGPT</h2>
<p class='p'>That’s the design: a governed loop that plans the day and enforces constraints. Product reference: <a href='https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach'>Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a>.</p>
