      <p class="p"><strong>Billionaire High-Performance Coach turns an LLM into a high-pressure executive coaching archetype, a cognitive-behavior–informed consultant (structure-first, nervous-system aware), an accountability mirror (direct, no hype), a Chief-of-Staff–style organizer, and a long-term systems designer.</strong></p>

<p class='p'>If your to-do list keeps failing, it’s usually because it’s not constrained. A list without governance becomes a guilt inventory.</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>The rule that fixes 80% of it</h2>
<ul><li>Cap the day at 3–7 actions.</li><li>Time-box each action.</li><li>No catch-up. Missed items get re-triaged, not dragged forward.</li><li>Minimum Viable Day exists for low-energy days.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class='quote'>Your list doesn’t need more items. It needs fewer decisions.</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>Use an LLM to plan the day</h2>
<p class='p'>If you want the plan generated for you (even from bed), run a daily operating loop inside an LLM. Product reference: <a href='https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach'>Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a>.</p>
