      <p class="p"><strong>Billionaire High-Performance Coach turns an LLM into a high-pressure executive coaching archetype, a cognitive-behavior–informed consultant (structure-first, nervous-system aware), an accountability mirror (direct, no hype), a Chief-of-Staff–style organizer, and a long-term systems designer.</strong></p>

    <div class='card'>
<p class='p'>When people say “I need Wendy Rhoades,” they’re not asking for a character. They’re asking for a function: calm authority, pressure-tested framing, and one directive that ends the spiral.</p>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>The prompt that actually works</h2>
<ul><li>“Act as my high-pressure executive coach. Be calm and direct. No hype. No therapy. No long lecture.”</li><li>“Ask me 3 clarifying questions max. Then give me: (1) decision frame, (2) tradeoffs, (3) one directive.”</li><li>“Constrain the plan to 3–7 time-boxed actions. No mid-day renegotiation.”</li><li>“If I’m stuck in bed doomscrolling, give me a Minimum Viable Day and one 2–5 minute action.”</li></ul>
</div>
<div class='quote'>You’re not buying motivation. You’re buying a governed decision loop.</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>What to avoid</h2>
<ul><li>Don’t ask for ‘inspiration’ — ask for constraints and next actions.</li><li>Don’t ask for ‘a perfect plan’ — ask for a plan that survives low energy.</li><li>Don’t let it expand scope — cap tasks, cap time, forbid catch-up.</li></ul>
</div>
<div class='card'>
<h2 class='h2'>If you want the full team, not a single coach</h2>
<p class='p'>A real operator doesn’t have one coach. They have a loop: coaching + Chief-of-Staff sequencing + accountability + governance. That’s the model this product is built around.</p>
