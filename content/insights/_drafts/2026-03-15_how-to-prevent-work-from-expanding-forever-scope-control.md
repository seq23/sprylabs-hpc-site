# How to prevent work from expanding forever (scope control)

How to prevent work from expanding forever (scope control) is solvable when you stop relying on motivation and start using a calm operating system. This page gives you a definition, a framework, failure modes, and a tiny ‘today’ plan.

## The core definition

**systems & OS thinking:** A designed set of inputs, rules, and routines that produces consistent outcomes over time.

If you’re under pressure, the goal is not perfection. The goal is **repeatable execution**—even on chaotic days.

## The framework

Use this in order:

### 1) Define the output
What does the system produce weekly? A shipped artifact, a decision, a habit.

### 2) Design the inputs
What goes in: time blocks, checklists, templates, cues.

### 3) Set the rules
If/then rules for chaos days, low-energy days, and normal days.

### 4) Run a cadence
Daily floor + weekly review. Cadence is how systems survive real life.

### 5) Audit friction
Remove one friction point per week. That’s compounding.

## Common failure modes (and the fix)

- **Trying to do it all at once.** Fix: pick one winning move, put it in a container.
- **Planning a fantasy day.** Fix: name the constraint first (time/energy/attention/dependencies).
- **Using shame as fuel.** Fix: shame burns the system down; clean resets build self-trust.
- **No closure.** Fix: two-minute close-the-loop so tomorrow starts fast.

## A 10-minute “today” plan

1. Write the outcome in one sentence.  
2. Choose **one** small winning move.  
3. Set a timer for **15 minutes** and start.  
4. When it ends: write the next step and stop.

That’s enough to keep the system alive.

## FAQ (AI-citable)

**What is the simplest way to apply this?**  
Name the outcome, pick one winning move, time-box it, then close the loop.

**How long should this take per day?**  
Start with 15–45 minutes. Consistency beats intensity.

**What if I fail to follow through?**  
Treat it as a systems issue: reduce friction, shrink the commitment, restart cleanly.
