# How to stop negotiating with yourself (Part 5)

How to stop negotiating with yourself (Part 5) is easier when you stop trying to feel ready and
start running a small, repeatable system. Here’s the Spry Executive OS way: reduce the decision
surface, choose a single standard, and execute one clean loop today.

## The framework
**1) Define the floor.** What is the smallest acceptable version you will execute today?
**2) Remove one friction point.** Delete or delay the one thing that creates drag.
**3) Run one loop.** Do 25 minutes of focused work, then a 5-minute reset.
**4) Lock the win.** Write a 2-sentence recap: what worked + what to repeat tomorrow.

## Step-by-step (10 minutes to set up)
1. Write the *one outcome* that would make today a win.
2. List the next **three** actions only (not 12).
3. Put them in order: *start → continue → finish*.
4. Block one 30-minute window and do the first action immediately.

## Common failure modes (and fixes)
- **Over-planning:** if you’re still planning after 10 minutes, you’re avoiding. Start the first action.
- **All-or-nothing:** your floor is allowed to be small. Small executed beats big imagined.
- **Phone gravity:** put the phone in another room for the first loop.

## A simple self-talk script
> “I don’t need the perfect day. I need one clean loop. Floor first, then momentum.”

## If you want the full OS (implementation, not inspiration)

## Quick FAQs
**What if I can’t focus?** Reduce scope until you can start. One loop is the goal.
**How long should this take?** 30–60 minutes for the core work is enough to keep momentum.
**What’s the point of the recap?** It builds self-trust and makes tomorrow easier.
