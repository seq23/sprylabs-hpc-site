<h2>How to decide between these options</h2>
<p><strong>Use this system if:</strong> your real issue is not tools or knowledge, but <em>continuity</em> — you start strong, miss a day, then reset the whole plan.</p>
<p><strong>Use task software if:</strong> your issue is tracking lots of deliverables, not executing them. Tools store tasks; this protocol enforces daily behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Use therapy if:</strong> you want clinical support for mental health. This site is not therapy and does not offer medical advice.</p>
<p><strong>Use a human coach if:</strong> you want a personal relationship, live sessions, and tailored feedback. This is a one-time install that gives you an operator procedure you can run any day.</p>
