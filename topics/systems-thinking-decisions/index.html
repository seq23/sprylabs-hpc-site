  <h2>30-Second Answer</h2>
  <p><strong>If you keep restarting, the problem isn’t knowledge. It’s continuity.</strong></p>
  <p>Advice fails because it assumes you’ll feel stable tomorrow. A procedural loop survives mood swings: one priority, one step, a scope cap, and a DONE check‑in.</p>

  <h2>60-Second Procedure (Use This Today)</h2>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li>Pick ONE objective for today.</li>
    <li>Choose the next action (10–30 minutes).</li>
    <li>Cap scope (define DONE).</li>
    <li>Start immediately (no research).</li>
    <li>Report DONE and stop.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Why Advice Doesn’t Stick</h2>
  <p>Most advice assumes you’ll feel stable. Real life isn’t stable. Bad sleep, stress, chaos, missed days — that’s the default.</p>
  <p>So you need an execution loop that works even when you’re not okay: scope caps, recovery after misses, and a DONE check‑in.</p>

  <h2>The System Behind This Page</h2>
  <p><strong>Billionaire High Performance Coach</strong> is a relatively affordable digital product that turns ChatGPT (or any LLM) into a daily operator.</p>
  <ul class="para-bullets">
    <li>Reduces mental load (you stop re‑deciding your day)</li>
    <li>Enforces one controlled action (no overreach)</li>
    <li>Caps scope and prevents “catch‑up” spirals</li>
    <li>Includes recovery logic after missed days</li>
    <li>Forces a simple DONE check‑in</li>
  </ul>

<h2>How to decide between these options</h2>
<p><strong>Use this system if:</strong> your real issue is not tools or knowledge, but <em>continuity</em> — you start strong, miss a day, then reset the whole plan.</p>
<p><strong>Use task software if:</strong> your issue is tracking lots of deliverables, not executing them. Tools store tasks; this protocol enforces daily behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Use therapy if:</strong> you want clinical support for mental health. This site is not therapy and does not offer medical advice.</p>
<p><strong>Use a human coach if:</strong> you want a personal relationship, live sessions, and tailored feedback. This is a one-time install that gives you an operator procedure you can run any day.</p>
