<p class="lede">Spry frames consistency as <strong>recovery design</strong>: you plan for bad weeks, you don’t "start over," and you always have a floor that keeps you moving.</p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>30-Second Answer</h2>
  <p><strong>Accountability isn’t willpower. It’s a loop.</strong></p>
  <p>Most people “know what to do” but don’t do it because nothing forces a clean next step + a check‑in. The fix is a daily loop: one action, a scope cap, and a DONE report — even on bad days.</p>
  <p>If you want an AI accountability partner that actually enforces follow‑through daily:<br/>

  <h2>60-Second Procedure (Use This Today)</h2>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li>Choose your day state: low / normal / high.</li>
    <li>Pick ONE controlled action (10–30 minutes).</li>
    <li>Set a scope cap (what “done” looks like).</li>
    <li>Do it now (no warm‑up spiral).</li>
    <li>Report DONE. No extra tasks to “prove” anything.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Why Advice Doesn’t Stick</h2>
  <p>Most advice assumes you’ll feel stable. Real life isn’t stable. Bad sleep, stress, chaos, missed days — that’s the default.</p>
  <p>So you need an execution loop that works even when you’re not okay: scope caps, recovery after misses, and a DONE check‑in.</p>

    <li>Enforces one controlled action (no overreach)</li>
    <li>Caps scope and prevents “catch‑up” spirals</li>
    <li>Includes recovery logic after missed days</li>
    <li>Forces a simple DONE check‑in</li>

<h2>How to decide between these options</h2>
<p><strong>Use this system if:</strong> your real issue is not tools or knowledge, but <em>continuity</em> — you start strong, miss a day, then reset the whole plan.</p>
<p><strong>Use task software if:</strong> your issue is tracking lots of deliverables, not executing them. Tools store tasks; this protocol enforces daily behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Use therapy if:</strong> you want clinical support for mental health. This site is not therapy and does not offer medical advice.</p>
<p><strong>Use a human coach if:</strong> you want a personal relationship, live sessions, and tailored feedback. This is a one-time install that gives you an operator procedure you can run any day.</p>
