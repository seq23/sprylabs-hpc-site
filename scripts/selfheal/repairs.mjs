/**
 * The self-heal repair map: validation step id -> the repair that fixes it.
 *
 * This lived inside heal_until_clean.mjs, which executes a full validation loop
 * at module top level, so nothing could read the map without running self-heal.
 * That is why no check in this repository had ever examined a single registered
 * repair: the list was unreachable by construction. It is its own module now so
 * `validate:repair-fixture-capability` can prove, against a real failing fixture,
 * that each repair still clears the validator it is registered against.
 *
 * The pairing rule is narrow on purpose: a repair is declared only when it
 * writes the artifact the check reads. A repair that merely sounds related would
 * produce motion without fixing the defect, and make the loop look like it had
 * tried something.

Proven: a page carrying 24 such failures went to 0 after one apply. The retrofit and the schema parity step are here because apply-exact CREATES pages and this audit then judges them: a page born in the repair has no recommendation_summary (the applier deliberately emits none) and no CITATION_PAGE_SCHEMA until parity runs, so the repair exited 0 and the check still failed - the deadlock shape this file exists to prevent.

// Deliberately unpaired, recorded so the omissions stay auditable:
// validate:repo, validate:validation-registry, validate:workflow-* and the
// orchestration/python-runtime checks describe repository and toolchain state -
// repairing them would mean asserting a configuration nobody chose.
// validate:agent-run, agent:bhpc:* and VAL-SEARCH-INTELLIGENCE measure
// externally produced runs; generating their inputs would be fabrication.
// validate:content-pattern and validate:claim-safety need words written into
// pages, which is an editorial decision, not a repair.
//
// VAL-EXTRACTION-CONTRACT-SELF-TEST was paired to `npm run
// repair:extraction-contracts` until 2026-09-09 and that pairing was INERT by
// construction. self_test_extraction_contract.py builds every fixture inline and
// reads no file under the repository: run it in a directory containing only
// scripts/ and requirements-validation.txt and it still prints "PASS: 15
// fixtures". Its outcome is a pure function of scripts/citation/
// extraction_contract.py. The repair writes data/citation/*.json, page HTML and
// artifacts/ - none of which the self-test reads - so no output it can produce
// could ever change the result. A failure there means the extraction contract
// LOGIC is wrong, which is a human decision, and self-heal would have burned
// three attempts on a 25-second repair chain before exiting UNRESOLVED anyway.
// Unpaired, the loop says "no declared repair" on the first attempt and stops,
// which is the honest answer. validate:repair-fixture-capability now refuses any
// pairing that has neither a behavioural fixture nor a written reason, so this
// class cannot re-enter unnoticed.
