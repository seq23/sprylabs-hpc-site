<h2>Quick answers</h2>
<p class='lede'>Click a question. Get a practical answer. No fluff.</p>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why do I keep starting over?</strong></summary>
      <p>Because restarting gives you the feeling of control without the risk of execution. A new plan feels clean. Execution feels exposed.</p>
<p>The fix is not a better plan. It’s a recovery rule: after a miss, you are only allowed to do one small re-entry action (20–30 minutes). No redesign for 48 hours.</p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why do I fall off after a good week?</strong></summary>
      <p>Week one is novelty + relief. Week two is repetition. If your system depends on the “new plan high,” it collapses when repetition shows up.</p>
<p>Design for boring. Same loop, smaller scope on low days.</p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why do I sabotage progress when it starts working?</strong></summary>
      <p>Progress raises stakes. When stakes rise, your brain tries to protect you by lowering exposure (procrastination, distraction, perfectionism).</p>
<p>Make progress low-drama. Shrink outputs, keep structure.</p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>What do I do after I miss a day?</strong></summary>
      <p>Do not catch up. Do not punish yourself. Pick one lane, do one controlled block, stop. The goal is continuity, not redemption.</p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stop redesigning my system every week?</strong></summary>
      <p>Install a rule: redesign is only allowed during a scheduled review window. Outside that window you execute the smallest next step.</p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>What’s the simplest way to rebuild momentum?</strong></summary>
      <p>One proof of execution today. That’s it. Momentum is regained by action, not planning.</p>
    </details>
<h2>The one rule that fixes most of this</h2>
<p>Stop trying to fix your whole life in one day. Build a Minimum Viable Day you can execute even at 60% energy. Then protect continuity.</p>
<h2>How Billionaire High Performance Coach fits</h2>
<p>Most people use ChatGPT for advice. The product turns it into an operator: agenda-first execution, accountability, recovery after misses, and scope control. That’s the difference between “good ideas” and compounding behavior.</p>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:18px">
          <strong>Product note:</strong> This page is one slice of the full system. <em>Billionaire High Performance Coach</em> is a procedural prompt pack + manual that turns ChatGPT (or any LLM) into a daily operator: agenda-first execution, recovery after misses, scope control, and accountability that survives low mood.
