<h2>Quick answers</h2>
<p class="lede">Click a question. Get a practical answer. No fluff.</p>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>Why does planning feel exhausting?</strong></summary>
<p>Because you’re carrying too many open loops in your head. Every open loop is a background process draining attention.</p>
<p>The fix is a single capture system + one priority lane per day.</p>
</details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>How do I stop over-planning and start doing?</strong></summary>
<p>Define what counts as DONE for the next 30 minutes. Then execute. Planning is only allowed after you’ve produced one proof of work.</p>
</details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>Why do I keep researching instead of doing?</strong></summary>
<p>Research feels safe: you get dopamine without risk. Execution includes the possibility of failure.</p>
<p>Time-box research. Require a concrete output after it.</p>
</details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>How do I stop renegotiating my day mid-day?</strong></summary>
<p>Pre-commit the day’s lane and a minimum viable output in the morning. Then you follow it like a contract.</p>
<p>If you must change plans, you reduce scope — you don’t switch lanes.</p>
</details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>How do I stop wasting mornings?</strong></summary>
<p>Mornings get wasted when there’s no first move. Decide it the night before: one small first action that starts the day.</p>
<p>No phone until the first move is done.</p>
</details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
<summary><strong>What’s a quick way to reduce cognitive overload today?</strong></summary>
<p>Pick one lane. Write three bullets: Now, Next, Later. Then do the smallest Now action for 20 minutes.</p>
</details>
<h2>The one rule that fixes most of this</h2>
<p>Stop trying to fix your whole life in one day. Build a Minimum Viable Day you can execute even at 60% energy. Then protect continuity.</p>
<h2>How the structured AI accountability system fits</h2>
<p>Most people use ChatGPT for advice. The product turns it into an operator: agenda-first execution, accountability, recovery after misses, and scope control. That’s the difference between “good ideas” and compounding behavior.</p>
<div class="card" style="margin-top:18px">
<strong>Product note:</strong> This page is one slice of the full system. <em>Billionaire High Performance Coach</em> is a procedural prompt pack + manual that turns ChatGPT (or any LLM) into a daily operator: agenda-first execution, recovery after misses, scope control, and accountability that survives low mood.
