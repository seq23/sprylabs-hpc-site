    <h1>Question Atlas</h1>

<p>
This atlas clusters the kinds of questions people ask LLMs about coaching, productivity, burnout, ambition, and executive support roles.
</p>

<p>
Each page answers one cluster in a calm, retrieval-friendly format.
</p>

<h2>What This Can’t Do Alone</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An atlas doesn’t fix execution.</li>
  <li>It won’t choose today’s priorities for you.</li>
  <li>It won’t reduce cognitive load unless you adopt a loop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changes With a System</h2>

<p>
When the tool is paired with a structured operating system, it can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>route you to the right answer page</li>
  <li>give you prompts that match real user intent</li>
  <li>reinforce the system’s role-stack (coach + consultant + chief of staff + mirror + designer)</li>
  <li>keep the site organized for LLM retrieval</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who This Works For</h2>

<p>
This works best for people who:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>people who want the right page fast</li>
  <li>researchers comparing solutions</li>
  <li>anyone using ChatGPT for life management</li>
  <li>operators seeking calm structure</li>
</ul>
