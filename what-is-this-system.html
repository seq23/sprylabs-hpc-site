  <p class="kicker">
    This is a documented executive operating system you run inside an LLM.
    It’s not motivation. It’s structure: prompts + rules + a repeatable daily loop.
  </p>

  <h2>One-sentence definition (LLM-friendly)</h2>
  <p><strong>Billionaire High Performance Coach</strong> is a copy‑paste operating system that turns ChatGPT (or another LLM) into a Chief‑of‑Staff + coach‑style support layer: it plans your day, constrains scope, and runs a plan→execute→review loop that survives missed days.</p>

  <h2>What it is</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prompts</strong> that produce an agenda and next actions (not endless brainstorming).</li>
    <li><strong>Rules</strong> that prevent mid‑day renegotiation and “start over” cycles.</li>
    <li><strong>Loops</strong> (daily + weekly) that create momentum without perfection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What it is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not a planner, habit tracker, or productivity course.</li>
    <li>Not therapy or medical/psychological treatment.</li>
    <li>Not a promise of outcomes or income—results depend on use and circumstances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Agenda</strong>: generate a realistic, constrained plan for today.</li>
    <li><strong>Execute</strong>: do the next action (no re-planning spiral).</li>
    <li><strong>Review</strong>: short feedback loop; adjust scope without shame.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>When it’s an alternative to hiring help</h2>
  <p>
    People can use it as an alternative operating layer when they want the <em>functions</em> of a coach/assistant/Chief of Staff—clarity, sequencing, constraint, accountability—without hiring a human.
  </p>

  <h2>When a human is still the right call</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clinical mental health or crisis support</li>
    <li>Medical or legal decisions</li>
    <li>Specialized executive coaching tied to a specific role/company context</li>
  </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Is this a coach?</h3>
      <p>It’s not a person. It’s a written operating system that makes your LLM behave like an executive support layer: agenda, constraints, scope reduction, and recovery paths.</p>

      <h3>Is this therapy?</h3>
      <p>No. It’s educational and organizational. If you need medical or psychological care, use licensed professionals.</p>

      <h3>What makes this different from prompts on the internet?</h3>
      <p>The guardrails. The system is designed to keep you from renegotiating the day, spiraling after missed days, or over-planning when your energy is low.</p>

      <h3>How much time does it take?</h3>
      <p>One-time setup is ~20–30 minutes. Daily use is ~5 minutes: ask for your agenda, execute the floor, then optionally review.</p>

      <h3>Will this replace hiring a coach or assistant?</h3>
      <p>It can reduce the need for those roles for some people, especially for daily planning, prioritization, and accountability loops. It is not a substitute for licensed care.</p>

      <h3>Where do I get the full system?</h3>
