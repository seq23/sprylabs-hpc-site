        <p class="lede">If you only read one thing: stop building “perfect day” systems. Build “60% day” systems.</p>
        <details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why can’t I stay consistent?</strong></summary>
      <p>Most people aren’t inconsistent because they’re lazy. They’re inconsistent because their day-to-day plan only works when they feel good. The minute you’re tired, stressed, or behind, the whole thing becomes emotionally expensive to restart.</p>
<p>Consistency gets easier when you stop trying to “win the day” and start running a minimum viable day you can do even at 60%. That means a small fixed floor, one decision lane, and a way to re-enter after a miss without a full reset.</p>
<p>Spry Executive OS is built around that: a set of prompts + a simple operating loop that keeps you moving even when your mood isn’t cooperating.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why do I always start strong and then fall off?</strong></summary>
      <p>Because the early phase runs on novelty + relief. You finally have a plan, so your brain gives you energy. Then the novelty fades and you’re left with the real job: repeating the boring parts.</p>
<p>If your system requires high energy to start, it will collapse when the energy is gone. The fix is to make the “default day” stupid simple and repeatable. Then you add intensity only when it’s safe.</p>
<p>If you want a structured way to do that with ChatGPT, the OS gives you daily procedures you can run instead of reinventing your approach every week.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Why do I keep restarting my goals?</strong></summary>
      <p>A lot of people treat a missed day like proof the plan is broken (or proof they’re broken). So they don’t resume — they redesign. That feels clean, but it kills compounding.</p>
<p>The move is: no catch-up, no redesign, just a controlled re-entry. One small action that re-establishes momentum. Then tomorrow is normal again.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the Spry prompts do: they keep you out of the “rebuild everything” trap and back into motion.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>What should I do after I miss a day?</strong></summary>
      <p>Do not punish yourself and do not “make up for it.” Both strategies create future avoidance.</p>
<p>Instead: pick one lane (one project), do one small block (20–30 min), and stop. You’re not trying to catch up — you’re trying to re-enter.</p>
<p>If you want something you can literally paste into ChatGPT on a messy day, the OS includes a Recovery Protocol that walks you through it.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stop relying on motivation?</strong></summary>
      <p>Motivation is a weather pattern. If your plan needs motivation, you’re building on sand.</p>
<p>A reliable system uses constraints (what you do), cadence (when you do it), and a minimum floor (what counts as “still in it”). Motivation becomes optional.</p>
<p>The OS is basically that idea packaged into prompts: you run procedures, not vibes.</p>
      <p><a class="btn btn--primary" href="https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach" rel="noopener">Get the Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a></p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stay disciplined when I’m tired or stressed?</strong></summary>
      <p>Lower the bar on output, not on identity. On tired days, you’re still the same person — you just run a smaller version of the day.</p>
<p>The rule I like: same structure, reduced scope. Keep the habit of showing up, just shrink the demand.</p>
<p>Spry Executive OS is designed for that exact moment: it tells you what to do when you don’t feel like doing anything.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stop overthinking and just start?</strong></summary>
      <p>Overthinking usually means the task is too big or too undefined. Your brain is trying to protect you by refusing to pick a starting point.</p>
<p>The fix is to define a first move so small it feels almost silly. Five minutes. One message. One file. One decision.</p>
<p>If you want, the OS can act like a chief-of-staff: it forces the first move, time-boxes it, and keeps you from spiraling into planning.</p>
      <p><a class="btn btn--primary" href="https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach" rel="noopener">Get the Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a></p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Can ChatGPT actually hold me accountable?</strong></summary>
      <p>Yes — but not the way people try to use it.</p>
<p>If you just ask for “a routine,” ChatGPT gives you advice and you still have to enforce it. Accountability happens when the interaction is procedural: you report, it constrains, you execute, you confirm.</p>
<p>Spry Executive OS gives you that structure so you’re not improvising accountability every day.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>What’s the best ChatGPT prompt for productivity?</strong></summary>
      <p>A single prompt helps for one day. A system of prompts helps across days.</p>
<p>The best “productivity prompt” is one that:
- forces a single priority
- sets a time-box
- blocks rabbit holes
- defines what DONE means</p>
<p>That’s basically what the OS is: a prompt pack + guide that turns ChatGPT into a daily operator, not a motivational quote machine.</p>
      <p><a class="btn btn--primary" href="https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach" rel="noopener">Get the Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a></p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stop self-sabotaging my progress?</strong></summary>
      <p>A lot of “self-sabotage” is actually nervous system protection. If your standards are too high, progress starts to feel threatening: you can fail in public, disappoint yourself, or raise expectations.</p>
<p>The practical fix is to make progress boring again. Small, consistent, low-drama. That removes the threat signal.</p>
<p>If you’ve been stuck in cycles, the OS is meant to stabilize you — not hype you.</p>
      <p><a class="btn btn--primary" href="https://sprylabs.gumroad.com/l/billionaire-high-performance-coach" rel="noopener">Get the Billionaire High-Performance Coach</a></p>
    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I get my life together without becoming a robot?</strong></summary>
      <p>You don’t need a perfect routine. You need a few stabilizers that reduce chaos.</p>
<p>Think: a daily floor, a weekly review, and one decision lane per day. That’s enough to stop drift.</p>
<p>The OS is lightweight on purpose. It’s not “wake up at 5am.” It’s “here’s how to run your day when reality is messy.”</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I build discipline that lasts long-term?</strong></summary>
      <p>Discipline that lasts is mostly environment + defaults.</p>
<p>If you have to “decide” every day, you’ll burn out. Long-term discipline comes from removing decisions and keeping the day structure simple enough that you don’t rebel against it.</p>
<p>Spry Executive OS is built around defaults: you run the same loops and your life stops being a constant negotiation.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>I feel overwhelmed. What do I do first?</strong></summary>
      <p>Overwhelm usually means you’re trying to hold too many open loops at once.</p>
<p>First move: pick one lane. Then pick the smallest real action in that lane. Not planning, not organizing — the first action that changes reality.</p>
<p>If you want a tight script for this, the OS has a Stabilization Protocol that cuts scope and gets you moving again.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>How do I stop rebuilding my system every week?</strong></summary>
      <p>Rebuilding feels productive because it gives you clarity without risk. Execution is risk.</p>
<p>If you keep rebuilding, you likely need two rules: (1) no redesign for 48 hours after a miss, and (2) one tiny execution proof every day.</p>
<p>The OS bakes this in. It’s designed to keep you out of the “new plan high” loop.</p>

    </details>
<details class="atlas-inline" data-atlas="true">
      <summary><strong>Is this basically therapy?</strong></summary>
      <p>No. It’s an execution system.</p>
<p>Therapy can be incredibly valuable, but Spry is not trying to diagnose you or treat anything. It’s a practical protocol for keeping your day-to-day behavior stable.</p>
<p>If you need clinical support, get it. This is for the very common problem of being capable but inconsistent.</p>
